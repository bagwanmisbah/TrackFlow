## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

The application is split into a backend (Spring Boot) and a frontend (React).

### 1. Run the Backend

The backend database is containerized for simplicity.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory and start the database:**
    ```bash
    # From the project's root directory
    cd backend
    docker-compose up
    ```
2.  **Run the Spring Boot application:**
    Open the project in your favorite IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA) and run the main application class. The backend API will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### 2. Run the Frontend

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    # From the project's root directory
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies and start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
The React application will now be running and accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
